Traditional farming: Earlier, farmers used plows and ox for plowing the field. They used to work themselves and sow the seeds. The cattle dung and natural manure were used as fertilizers in order to enrich the soil with nutrients. The farmers were also dependent on the monsoon rains for water and used to obtain only a single type of crop/year. Human laborers were required for harvesting the crops. As the population increased exponentially over the years, traditional farming methods seemed inefficient to fulfill the demands. Various regions across the world faced food shortages such as Bengal Famine in 1943. People were unable to even afford one meal/ day during the famine. The Bengal famine has wiped out approximately 3 million people in India because of starvation. Post independence, India was mainly an agricultural country and the agriculture sector contributed approx 33 % of India’s GDP and provided employment to nearly 62% of the population. Green revolution: These were a set of initiatives that enhanced and revolutionized agriculture thereby resulting in increased crop production. The green revolution was initiated by Dr. Norman E Borlaug in Mexico during the 1950s. It was launched in India in the mid-1960s by the Ministry of Agriculture. Improvement measure: Use of tractors for ploughing the fields, use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers to increase the yield, use of pumps to obtain water from rivers, etc thereby reducing the dependence on monsoons, laborers replaced by the modern machines. However, the land suitable for agriculture is limited and thus there was a need to increase the yields per unit area. To do this, many high-yielding varieties were imported from across the world and cultivated in India. These high-yielding varieties were further modified to suit the Indian climate by Dr. M S Swaminathan who is also known as the ‘Father of Green Revolution in India’. High yielding varieties (HYVs): Norman developed a semi-dwarf wheat variety at International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement, Mexico. In comparison to the indigenous wheat varieties that are long-statured, require more nutrients, and produce fewer yields, the semi-dwarf varieties were short-statured, require lesser nutrients, and produce a high yield. For wheat, Kalyan Sona and Sonalika were HYVs that are resistant to wheat rust, short-statured, and have a short maturity duration. These were cultivated across the whole wheat belt of India. The wheat production enhanced from 11 million tonnes to 75 million tonnes from 1960 to 200 due to these varieties. IR 8 is a dwarf, high-yielding variety of rice that was developed by the Philippines. IR 8 was derived from a tall high yielding variety from Indonesia and a sturdy dwarf variety from Taiwan. Taichung Native -1 is also a disease-resistant (resistant to blast disease) dwarf rice variety found in Taiwan. The rice varieties Ratna and Jaya were developed from IR 8 and Taichung Native-1 respectively. This resulted in an increase in rice production from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes from 1960 to 2000. Sugarcane: Saccharum Barberi grows in North India while Saccharum officinarum grows in South India. Barberi has a thin stem, lower sugar content, and lower yield while Officinarum has a thick stem, high sugar content, and higher yield. However, Saccharum officinarum did not grow well in north India. The two species were therefore crossed successfully to obtain a sugarcane variety containing all the desirable qualities. Millets: They are also called ‘coarse grains’ and are fed to the animals. They are grown in the arid regions and include maize, jowar, bajra, finger millet, etc. The high-yield varieties of millets that are resistant to water stress were developed in India. Measures of Green Revolution: It involved the use of HYVs, use of agriculture machinery, use of fertilizers and pesticides, and use of pumps. Pros and cons of HYVs: The use of HYVs increased crop production, profited the farmers, and reduced food prices. However, it also resulted in the extinction of indigenous varieties and a lack of biodiversity in the crops. Pros and cons of using fertilizers and pesticides: The crops were produced in higher yields and the losses were reduced significantly. However, they resulted in water and soil pollution, and are harmful to humans as well. Pros and cons of the use of agriculture machinery: They reduced the labor costs but also resulted in extreme financial burden on them and replacement of human labour with machines led to loss of the jobs.
