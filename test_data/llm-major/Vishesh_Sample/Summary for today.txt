Summary for today's session: "Microbes are everywhere around us. Microbes are tiny living organisms that are not visible to the naked eyes. They are ubiquitous and are found in soil, water and the air around us. They are also found in extreme habitats such as snow, deep hydrothermal vents, etc. We can visualize these microbes with the help of a light microscope wherein we can magnify them up to 1000-1500 times their original size. We can visualize bacteria (at 1000X), fungi (at 1000X), protozoans (at 1000X), and even viruses (at 100000X-150000X) such as adenovirus, TMV, bacteriophages. Viroids which are infectious RNA molecules capable of causing diseases in plants can be seen after magnification of 100000X. Prions which are infectious protein molecules can also be visualized under 100000X magnification. Microbes can be grown on a nutritive medium which is composed of water, agar, salts, sugars, vitamins, and amino acids. The microbes multiply and form colonies on the nutritive media which is visible to the naked eye. Fungal hyphae and spores can be observed on the nutritive media when cultured. The bacterial colonies are spherical or rod-shaped and are easily visible on the media. We obtain many household products with the help of microbes. e.g. Lactobacillus (LAB) helps in the formation of curd, fungi helps in the production of bread, etc. Bacteria in household products: Curd is a fermented product and has lactobacillus bacteria. The bacteria can survive in acidic environments and outcompete other bacteria. Thus, the food fermented by LAB is free from other harmful bacteria. Curd possesses a number of benefits. These are- 1) Curd has increased nutritional value with a good amount of Vitamin B12. 2) it is easy to digest. 3) It is very beneficial for gut health since it acts as a probiotic. 4) It can be consumed by people who are lactose intolerant. 5) It provides good texture and enhances the flavour of food. Process of curd formation: Warm milk is a mixture of fat globules, casein protein, lactose, whey, calcium, phosphates, etc. To this, a spoon of curd is added as an inoculum. This process is called inoculation. The spoon of curd possesses lactic acid bacteria which take up the lactose sugar and break it down to glucose and galactose. Further, glycolysis of glucose results in the formation of pyruvate. Pyruvate further gets converted to lactic acid in anaerobic conditions. The lactic acid reduces the pH of the milk to 4 within 6 hours. The proteins casein and whey start to denature due to this reduced pH. Apart from the role in the formation of curd, Lactobacillus also plays a role in the fermentation of dosa and idli batter. South Indian Delicacies: Just like curd, fluffy idlis and crispy dosas are the products formed as a result of lactic acid fermentation. Rice and black gram are soaked in water overnight and ground to make the batter. The batter is left overnight for fermentation. The lactic acid bacteria present in the black gram release lactic acid and leave the batter. Similarly, foods such as flavored yogurt, dhokla, pickles, buttermilk and cheese are the products formed as a result of lactic acid fermentation. Swiss cheese: Multiple bacteria make the Swiss cheese. The LAB converts lactose to lactic acid. Propionibacterium shermanii uses this lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide and propionic acid. The carbon dioxide bubbles cause holes in the cheese. Mouldy bread: The green patches of fungi are present on stale bread. The bread is made of unicellular fungus, yeast. It is also known as baker’s yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is also used in making bakery products as it makes the food fluffy. Fungi in household products: Process of bread making: In order to make bread, wheat flour, sugar, salt, oil, water and yeast are added. The dough is kneaded. Wheat flour contains gluten protein which forms a meshwork when the flour is kneaded. The meshwork imparts structure and chewiness to the bread. Yeast tangles in this mesh, utilizes simple carbohydrates like sugars and converts them into ethanol and carbon dioxide by anaerobic respiration. After the dough is baked, carbon dioxide escapes thereby, making the bread soft and porous. The bakery items such as pizza, bread, donut, croissant, cinnamon buns, bagels, etc. Ancient Egyptians– Bakers and Brewers: Egyptians used to bake bread and were also known to brew wine. To ensure food security, fermentation was used to preserve food till the next harvest. Wine making: To make wine, grapes are collected, crushed, the juice is extracted and allowed to ferment for a longer time. Fermentation enhances flavors, preserves food without refrigeration and provides health benefits. Toddy: It is made from the sap of sugar palm/toddy palm trees. People, after climbing the trees, cut the base of the leaves of the sugar palm trees. The pots are then tied and the sap is collected. Yeast is naturally present in the sap and it ferments the sap. The fermented drink is then served after a few hours as “toddy”. Roquefort cheese or blue cheese: It is made of goat’s milk using Penicillium roqueforti. The milk is pasteurized, LAB is added along with enzyme rennet. Rennet hydrolyses casein protein thereby allowing it for gel-like consistency called curds. The liquid is then drained from the curds. Following this, Penicillium roqueforti is sprinkled on the cheese after which the cheese ripens for 60-90 days thereby giving us the blue cheese. Camembert cheese: It is made of cow’s milk and the mold Penicillium camemberti. It is a smooth cheese. The fungi provide hydrolytic enzymes that soften and digest the cheese, giving a smooth structure. "
