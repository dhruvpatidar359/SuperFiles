The experimental arrangement of the Davisson Germer experiment is discussed below: : - 1.An electron gun comprising a tungsten filament F was coated with barium oxide and heated through a low voltage power supply.2.While applying suitable potential difference from a high voltage power supply, the electron gun emits electrons which were again accelerated to a particular velocity.3.In a cylinder perforated with fine holes along its axis, these emitted electrons were made to pass through it, thus producing a fine collimated beam.4.The beam produced from the cylinder is again made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. Due to this, the electrons scatter in various directions.5.The beam of electrons produced has a certain amount of intensity which is measured by the electron detector and after it is connected to a sensitive galvanometer (to record the current), it is then moved on a circular scale.6.By moving the detector on the circular scale at different positions that is changing the Î¸ (angle between the incident and the scattered electron beams), the intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values of angle of scattering..
