Histologic sections were made from selected regions of the brains of 25 schizophrenic patients aged 21 to 54 years (mean, 43.5 years) who died during their hospitalization
 at St Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, DC. These sections were compared with similarly prepared
  sections from the same brain regions of 28 nonschizophrenic patients of similar age, who were
   hospitalized and died at the same hospital during the same period, and with sections from 20
    age-matched, nonpsychiatric patients who died in a general hospital. Although few differences
     were apparent in material from schizophrenic and nonpsychiatric cases in sections stained 
     for cellular structures, myelin, or axis cylinders, Holzer's stain for glial fibrils 
     demonstrated increased fibrillary gliosis that affected principally the periventricular
      structures of the diencephalon, the periaqueductal region of the mesencephalon, or the
       basal forebrain in three fourths of the brains from schizophrenic subjects. Hypothalamus
       , midbrain tegmentum, and substantia innominata were most often affected. The nature and
        distribution of the findings suggest previous or low-grade inflammation. Review of the
         clinical history and course of each case allows some correlations to be made between 
         clinical signs and histopathologic data.
