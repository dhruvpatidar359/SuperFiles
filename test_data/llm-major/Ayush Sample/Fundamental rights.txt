Fundamental rights are a set of legal protections granted to individuals to ensure their basic freedoms and well-being within a society. These rights are typically enshrined in a nation's constitution or legal framework, serving as a cornerstone for justice and democracy. Fundamental rights often include the right to life, liberty, and security; freedom of speech and expression; freedom of religion and belief; and the right to a fair trial. They also encompass the rights to privacy, equality before the law, and protection from discrimination. The safeguarding of these rights is essential for the functioning of a just and equitable society, as they empower individuals to participate fully in social, political, and economic life. By upholding fundamental rights, societies can promote individual dignity, social harmony, and the overall advancement of humanity.
