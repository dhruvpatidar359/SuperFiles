Yoga, an ancient practice and meditation, has become increasingly popular in today's busy society. For many people, yoga provides a retreat from their chaotic and busy lives. This is true whether you're practicing downward facing dog posture on a mat in your bedroom, in an ashram in India, or even in New York's Times Square. Yoga provides many other mental and physical benefits. Some of these extend to the kitchen table.
