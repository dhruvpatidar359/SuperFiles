The Global Health Crises Task Force was established by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2016 to support and monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the High-level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises, issued in its report on “Protecting humanity from future health crises” (A/70/723). The Task Force sought to ensure that the implementation of the Panel’s recommendations was aligned with the observations of the Secretary-General as set out in his report on “Strengthening the global health architecture” (A/70/824).

The Task Force also sought to catalyse action on the Panel’s recommendations, enhance the preparedness of the UN system, maintain the profile of global health issues, and make substantive contributions to strengthening the global capability for responding to health emergencies.
