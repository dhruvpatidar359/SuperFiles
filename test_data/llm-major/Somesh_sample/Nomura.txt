Problem Statement :
Financial literacy is an important skill that helps people make smart decisions with their
money. Many young people, particularly those supported by NGOs, lack access to quality
financial education. This deficiency can hinder their ability to manage finances effectively,
leading to economic instability. This problem is especially pronounced among students from
underprivileged backgrounds, who may not have the necessary resources or guidance to
learn these skills.
Proposed Solution :
The website should feature two engaging modes: Role Playing and Real Life :
1. Role playing : In this scenario, users can choose their respective roles, such as
Ram (M, age 25) and Aditi (F, age 25). Users will engage in activities that mirror
real-life responsibilities and decisions, such as earning salary , planning monthly
budget based on salary, paying taxes, managing assets and liabilities, investing in
stocks or mutual funds, and taking out loans. This immersive experience allows
users to navigate financial and career decisions, providing a realistic glimpse into
adult life.
Also there will be some more advanced challenges like financial challenges or
unexpected events like medical expenses , car repair , etc , Real estate investment
which enable users to invest in virtual real estate properties, understanding the
complexities of property management, rental income, and market fluctuations ,
Entrepreneurship which introduces a path for users to start their own virtual
businesses in which they can make decisions on business planning, funding,
marketing, and operational management and many others.2. Real Life :
●
●
●
Integrate Expense and savings tracker with user friendly interface.
Encourage regular use through gamified incentives like virtual
money/points that you can use to invest within the app, badges, levels
for consistent tracking and savings milestones.
Engage in daily quests centred around financial topics and terms.
Completing these quests not only enhances your financial knowledge
but also rewards you with virtual money. You can then use this virtual
money in our investment simulator, allowing you to practise and refine
your investment strategies.
Implement an investment simulator on which you can buy or sell
shares of virtual companies using the virtual money/points earned by
completing quests, or by achieving milestones.
