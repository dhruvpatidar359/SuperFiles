1. For the following problems, write pseudocode solutions and state the worse case running time
(in terms of Θ or O where appropriate). Also give the correctness of the yours algorithms. You
will be graded on the efficiency of your solutions. After that implement the algorithms in any
programming language and verified the complexity of the yours algorithm.
Problem 1: Given 3 strings of all having length ¡ 100, write a program to find the longest
common sub-sequence in all three given sequences.
Problem 2: Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these ma-
trices together. The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to
decide in which order to perform the multiplications. Write a program to find the contiguous
subsequence of maximum sum (a subsequence of length zero has sum zero). A contiguous
subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive elements of S. For instance,
if S is 5; 15;-30; 10;-5; 40; 10; then 15;-30; 10 is a contiguous subsequence but 5; 15; 40 is
not. For the preceding example, the answer would be 10;-5; 40; 10, with a sum of 55. Give a
linear-time algorithm for the following task:
Problem 3: A subsequence is palindromic if it is the same whether read left to right or right to
left. For instance, the sequence A;C; G; T; G; T;C; A; A; A; A; T;C;G has many palindromic
subsequences, including A;C; G;C;A and A; A; A;A (on the other hand, the subsequence A;C;
T is not palindromic). Devise an algorithm that takes a sequence x[1 : : : n] and returns the
(length of the) longest palindromic subsequence. Its running time should be O(n2 ).
Problem 4: A list of n positive integers a1 ; a2 ; :::; an ; and a positive integer t is given. Write a
program to find subset of the ai ’s add up to t? (You can use each ai at most once.)
Problem 5: A vertex cover of a graph G = (V;E) is a subset of vertices S ⊂ V that includes
at least one endpoint of every edge in E. Give & write a linear-time algorithm for finding
the size of the smallest vertex cover of T. For instance, in the following tree, possible vertex
covers include A;B;C;D;E; F;G and A;C;D; F but not C;E;F. The smallest vertex cover has
size 3: B;E;G.
Problem 6: Write a program for the following 3-PARTITION problem. Given integers a1 ; :::; an ,
we want to determine whether it is possible to partition of 1; : : : ; n into three disjoint subsets
I;J;K such that For example, for input (1; 2; 3; 4; 4; 5; 8) the answer is yes, because there is
the partition (1; 8), (4; 5), (2; 3; 4). On the other hand, for input (2; 2; 3; 5) the answer is
no. Write a program and analyze a dynamic programming algorithm for 3-PARTITION that
runs in time polynomial in n.
Problem 7: Write a program that calculates the highest sum of numbers passed on a route that
starts at the top and ends somewhere on the base.

For the above figure shows a number triangle and its output is 30(7,3,8,7,5). Each step can
go either diagonally down to the left or diagonally down to the right.
1Problem 8: Cutting cloth: You are given a rectangular piece of cloth with dimensions X x Y
, where X and Y are positive integers, and a list of n products that can be made using the
cloth. For each product i 2 [1; n] you know that a rectangle of cloth of dimensions ai x bi is
needed and that the final selling price of the product is ci. Assume the ai, bi, and ci are all
positive integers. You have a machine that can cut any rectangular piece of cloth into two
pieces either horizontally or vertically. Design an algorithm that determines the best return
on the X xY piece of cloth, that is, a strategy for cutting the cloth so that the products made
from the resulting pieces give the maximum sum of selling prices. You are free to make as
many copies of a given product as you wish, or none if desired.
Problem 9: Consider the problem of examining a string x = x1x2 : : : xn of characters from an
alphabet on k symbols, and a multiplication table over this alphabet, and deciding whether
or not it is possible to parenthesize x in such a way that the value of the resulting expression
is a, where a belongs to the alphabet. The multiplication table is neither commutative nor
associative, so the order of multiplication matters.
For example, consider the following multiplication table and the string bbbba. Parenthesizing
it (b(bb))(ba) gives a, but ((((bb)b)b)a) gives c. Give an algorithm, with time polynomial in
n and k, to decide whether such a parenthesization exists for a given string, multiplication
table, and goal element.
Problem 10: In the art gallery guarding problem, a line L represents a long art gallery hallway.
We are given a set of location points on it X=x0 , x1 , ..., xn−1 of real numbers that specify the
positions of the paintings along the hallway. A single guard can guard paintings standing at
most 1 meter from each painting on either side. Design an algorithm that finds the optimal
number of guards to guard all the paintings along the hallway.
