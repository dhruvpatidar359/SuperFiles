he earliest and most important empire to be established in the Indian subcontinent was the Mauryan Empire. Founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE, the vast Mauryan Empire, ranging from the Oxus valley to the Kaveri delta, was given a well-knit centralized administration by its rulers. Chandragupta was a great warrior as well as a capable administrator. In his vast empire, he established competent and efficient administrative machinery. In organizing his administration, he was supported by the famous diplomat and politician Kautilya (also known as Chanakya) who was his guru. Chandragupta political system was largely based on the ideals outlined in Kautilya’s Arthashastra.[1] The Arthashastra of Kautilya contains information regarding the Mauryan empire’s administrative system. Besides, the edicts of Asoka are another important source that shed light on the centralized administrative system developed by the Mauryan emperors. Further, we have epigraphical sources, literary sources, foreign narratives, and archaeological excavation materials about Mauryan rulers. Mauryan Empire left behind itself a great legacy of centralized government and administration for the later rulers, which continues to this day; for example, the Lion Capital of Mauryan king Ashoka, located at Sarnath is adopted as the national emblem of the Republic of India.
